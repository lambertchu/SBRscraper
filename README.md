# SBRscraper
Script to scrape SBR's betting-odds. Can be tailored for other sports and other books. Originally forked from [this repo](https://github.com/SharpChiCity/SBRscraper), but has been slightly modified to include final scores and multiple games per execution.

# Research notebook
As part of [my blog post](https://lambertchu.com/2020/12/30/can-you-make-money-by-betting-on-underdogs-in-the-nba), I created a Jupyter notebook to analyze the profitability of betting on NBA games. The notebook can be found at [sbr_profitability.ipynb](https://github.com/lambertchu/SBRscraper/blob/master/sbr_profitability.ipynb).
